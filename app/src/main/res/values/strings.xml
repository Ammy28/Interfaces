    <string name="txtProfileDesc">She is first encountered when Nanashi meets with the current leaders of the Ring of Gaea, Mii and Kei, in order to infiltrate Tsukiji Konganji. Toki would show them the way into the temple, though she states that her task is to assassinate two individuals, those being Maitreya and Flynn, the reason being that Kei and Mii cannot forgive Flynn for killing Yuriko. Upon finding Flynn, she tries to assassinate him on the spot, but her attempt is stopped by Isabeau, who declared she would not allow her to kill Flynn. Toki tries to eliminate them in order to get at Flynn, but she is easily defeated and repelled back the party. Maitreya appears and knocks her away, knocking off her mask in the process.</string>
